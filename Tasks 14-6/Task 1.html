            cats 
            â€œgive us attention, 
            relieve our loneliness, provide comfort, fun, and play, affection,
        </br>and special unique permission to stroke/ pet them and keep them on our
         laps, which we know releases oxytocin,</br>br which in turn suppresses the
         production of cortisol, a stress hormone.
